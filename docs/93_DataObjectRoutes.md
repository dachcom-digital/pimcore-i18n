# DataObject Routes

## Alternate Links
Alternate links ([`hreflang`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLLinkElement/hreflang))
are generated and injected automatically for the active UrlSlug object field. This only works for objects/routes,
which use the [Pimcore UrlSlug data type](https://docs.pimcore.com/platform/Pimcore/Objects/Object_Classes/Data_Types/Others/#url-slug).
