# Create a website with language context

1. [Enable all](https://pimcore.com/docs/5.0.x/Multi_Language_i18n/index.html) required languages in pimcore backend.
2. [Localize your Documents](https://pimcore.com/docs/5.0.x/Multi_Language_i18n/Localize_your_Documents.html).
3. Connect them via the localization tool.

**Localization Connector:** There is a [dedicated help document](100_LocalizeDocuments.md) we wrote for you to get all the knowledge for heroic document localization!

> **Note:** Make sure that all your child documents are localized too.

For multi-language sites (e.g. example.org/de and example.org/en): Please ensure that the site document (domain, e.g. example.org) does not have a defined language (Document => Tab "Navigation & Settings" => "Language" Dropdown: Select `None` and save). 
For singe-language sites you have to set the language on the site document.
